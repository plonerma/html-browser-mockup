# Mock Up of a Browser window

Mock up of a browser window I wrote for [powerplace.io](//powerplace.io).

## Dependencies

- Fontawesome is used for the three control icons next to the control bar.
- *Jquery is not required (and was just used for demonstration purposes).*

Make sure to link to fontawesome and include the style file.

## Demo
